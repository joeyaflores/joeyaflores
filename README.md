Lead Software Engineer @ Herzog. Experience building full-stack applications within the railroad industry. 

Outside of work I'm an avid runner, blending software development and running with personal projects such as ourpr.app and runlete.io.

Python, Go, and React are my go-to's. Tools such as Apache Airflow, Docker, and Kubernetes are in my wheelhouse.
