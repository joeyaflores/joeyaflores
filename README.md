# Hi, I’m Joey Flores

**Lead Software Engineer @ Herzog Technologies** — trusted early with ownership of safety-critical, data-intensive systems in the railroad industry. I focus on building backend-heavy products, production pipelines, and infrastructure that operate reliably under real-world constraints.

Outside of work, I’m a competitive runner and solo builder, shipping products that blend software, data, and endurance sports.
